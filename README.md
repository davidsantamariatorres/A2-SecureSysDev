# A2-SecureSysDev
This project contains an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in C. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data. The implementation provides functions for both encryption and decryption of data blocks.

Unit test can be found in the file called test1.py located in the tests folder. I tried different ways to to get Python to recognise the aes folder as a Python module, but I always obtain the same error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aes'.
